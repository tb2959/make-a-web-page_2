           <h2>Lesson 1</h2>

         <div class="HTML"><h1>HTML</h1>
            <p>The primary type of documents on the internet are <b>HTML</b>. HTML (<em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>) documents are a tree-like structure made up of <em>elements</em>. These <em>elements</em> have a beginning and ending tag; of which, can be text, spans, paragraphs, etc. So you can have elements within other elements.</p>
         </div>

         <div class="TAGS"><h1>TAGS</h1> 
           <p>Tags make up elements and allow you to affect the output of the <em>code</em> that is written. You can turn words into <a href="www.udacity.com">links</a> to other websites or even <img src= "URL" alt="Not Available"> images. There are two types of tags <b><em>inline</em></b> and <b>block</b>. Inline allows the code to run continuously without structure around it. Whereas <b>block</b> contains the content within a virtual box with adjustable height and width.</p>
         </div>

         <div class="CSS"><h1>CSS</h1>
           <p>CSS compliments HTML by providing  <em>style</em> to the elements. These can include text & background color, alignment, height and width.</p>
         </div>

         <div class="REPETITION"><h1>Avoiding Repetition</h1>
           <p>Avoiding repetition is important to avoid rework and errors. Applying the same style to multiple elements can mean having to reapply it over and over. Attention to detail when making the changes is crucial. If the overall design requires a consistent format, the programmer can assign the same div class to each element and make the changes simultaneously.</p>
